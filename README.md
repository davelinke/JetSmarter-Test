# Flight Opertator Panel

This is an AngularJS/Grunt exercise to propose a basic prototype of flight operation panel.

It is derived also by one of those coding exercises you do for interviews.

Essentially you could say it can represent a good starting point for an Angular JS application.

You can check a running example of this implementation at http://jetsmarter.davelinke.com/
